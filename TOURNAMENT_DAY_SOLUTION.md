# üèà TOURNAMENT DAY - WORKING SOLUTION

## The Problem
Netlify Blobs is having issues persisting data. We don't have time to debug this before tomorrow.

## ‚úÖ WORKING SOLUTION: Run Locally with ngrok

Your **local SQLite database works perfectly**. Use this for the tournament:

### Step 1: Start Your Local Server
```bash
cd /Users/stuartleech/squidgames
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Install and Run ngrok
```bash
# Install ngrok (if not installed)
brew install ngrok

# In a NEW terminal window:
ngrok http 3000
```

### Step 3: Share the ngrok URL
ngrok will give you a public URL like:
```
https://abc123.ngrok.io
```

**Share this URL** with anyone who needs to view scores!

### Step 4: Access Admin
```
https://abc123.ngrok.io/admin
Password: _Squid-Games-2025!_
```

## ‚úÖ Why This Works

1. **Data persists** - Uses SQLite (`tournament.db`)
2. **Publicly accessible** - ngrok creates a tunnel
3. **Real-time updates** - All features work
4. **No data loss** - Everything is saved locally
5. **Battle-tested** - We know this works!

## üéØ During the Tournament

1. Keep your laptop on and connected to internet
2. Keep the terminal windows open (npm dev + ngrok)
3. Update scores in the admin panel
4. Everyone can view live standings at the ngrok URL

## üîÑ If Connection Drops

If ngrok disconnects, just run `ngrok http 3000` again and share the new URL.

## üìä After the Tournament

Your data will be saved in `tournament.db` - you can export it or migrate it later.

**This is the reliable solution for tomorrow. Your local setup has been working perfectly all along!**
